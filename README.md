# Speech Recognition Maze

This project uses TensorFlow.js speech language modelling to allow users to speak into their microphone and guide the coloured square along the maze to the finishing line.

Specifically, it builds upon:

-   [Google's Teachable Machine web-based tool](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) in order to quickly build a comparative language assessing model
-   [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling
-   [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/) for the development environment
-   [Canvas confetti](https://github.com/catdad/canvas-confetti) as a third-party package used for extra UX
